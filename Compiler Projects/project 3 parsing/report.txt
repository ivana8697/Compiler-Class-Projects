3. Provide a short description of how you approached each problem, issues you 
   encountered, and how you resolved those issues.

   Problem 1 (Long and Double Basic Types)
      Approach: Add doubles and longs to the parser and to types.

      Issues and resolution: This was pretty strightforward I just did not
      realize that we have to account for basic types and for literals, so after
      seeing the errors when I ran the test and it said "literal sought where
      double found" I could see I needed to account for literals and then found
      and changed that part of the parser. Then I still had something off and
      knew I needed to be able to tell if was basic or literal and then updated
      seeBasicType() in the parser to be able to return a boolean so we can tell
      if it is a basic type or not.

   Problem 2 (Operators):
      Approach: Add parser support for operators.

      Issues and resolution: I got confused with the levels of the parser on the
      first assignment and this time I fixed the parser levels and did any
      additional levels I needed following the java syntax outlines in appendix
      C of the textbook. Everything was working pretty well except line 20 in
      the test because I got the error "|| found where ) sought" and this tells
      me that the parser thinks that for the case "(a == b || b == a);" there is
      only one comparison to do. I asked about the issue on piazza and then I
      realized it was just a very simple mistake of not updating a level so
      "assignmentExpression()" didnt call to my conditional expression then it
      cant get to ConditionalOrExpression(). I see that every little detail
      counts!

   Problem 3 (Conditional Expression):
      Approach: I addressed this part when I was working on 2 because I was
      trying to make all the levels shown in the text.

      Issues and resolution: Made sure to address how the '?' needs to have a
      ':' after the right hand expression of '?'.

   Problem 4 (Do Statement):
      Approach: Do statment is in statment() (also shown in appendix C)

      Issues and resolution: pretty strightforward, just made sure to have while
      and semi colon.

   Problem 5 (For Statement):
      Approach: Add for statement into statement(). I added the forInit() and
      forUpdate() where they needed to go in parser (Apendix C) so that the for
      statement can return a list for variable declaration if variables are not
      declared locally.

      Issues and resolution: minor debugging.

   Problem 6 (Break Statement):
      Approach: Add break statement into statement().

      Issues and resolution: straightforward.

   Problem 7 (Continue Statement):
      Approach: Add continue statement into statement(), just make sure the
      syntax is correct with a semicolon after.

      Issues and resolution: straightforward.

   Problem 8 (Switch Statement):
      Approach: Add switch statement into statement(). Created 
      switchBlockStatementGroup() in the parser where it should go followed by
      switchLabel(). Made sure that in switchBlockStatementGroup it parses a
      block statement until there is a CASE, DEFLT, or RCURLY reached to break
      the while loop.

      Issues and resolution: minor debugging.

   Problem 9 (Exception Handlers):
      Approach: Made sure that Try supports catch and finally and that they have
      the correct syntax. Added support for Throws and made sure to update
      memberDecl to support Throws in constructor, void method and non void
      method.

      Issues and resolution: minor debugging.

   Problem 10 (Interface Type Declaration):
      Approach: I modified type declaration to accept interface
      declaration an I had to add interfaceDeclaration(), interfaceBody(), and
      interfaceMemberDecl().

      Issues and resolution: It was mostly just time consuming to add all the
      details neccesary and debug small issues along the way.

5. List any other comments here. Feel free to provide any feedback on how
   much you learned from doing the assignment, and whether you enjoyed
   doing it.

   Appendix C was a really helpful guide to see where to update the parser.
